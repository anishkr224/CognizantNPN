**To:** Management
**From:** Compliance Reporting Officer
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Subject:** Summary of Findings, Financial Impact, and Recommendations from the Recent Forensic Billing Audit

### **1. Executive Summary**

A comprehensive forensic audit of our billing system was conducted to identify and quantify discrepancies. The analysis revealed significant issues across multiple areas, including duplicate billing, phantom charges, usage mismatches, incorrect rates, and missing charges.

A total of **226 errors** were identified. Based on the quantifiable data available, the immediate net financial impact is a **loss of $266.55**. This figure represents a significant liability from over-billing that outweighs the recoverable revenue from under-billing.

It is critical to note that this financial impact is preliminary. The full financial impact of **11 duplicate invoice groups** and **182 usage mismatches** could not be calculated due to data limitations and requires further investigation. The actual net loss is expected to be substantially higher.

This report recommends immediate corrective actions to rectify known errors, a dedicated investigation to quantify the full financial impact, and systemic improvements to prevent future occurrences.

### **3. Detailed Financial Impact**

The known financial impact is broken down into over-billing (revenue loss/liability) and under-billing (revenue recovery opportunities).

#### **3.1. Over-Billing (Total Known Liability: -$706.47)**

This represents direct financial risk and potential damage to customer trust.

*   **Duplicate Billing:** -$495.36
    *   *Based on 10 of 21 identified duplicate groups. The financial impact of the remaining 11 groups is currently unknown.*
*   **Phantom Billing:** -$211.11
    *   *Invoices were generated for services with no corresponding usage logs.*

#### **3.2. Under-Billing (Total Known Revenue Recovery: +$439.92)**

This represents immediate opportunities to recover unbilled revenue.

*   **Missing Charges:** +$310.50
    *   *Contracted services and fees that were never invoiced.*
*   **Billing Rate Discrepancies:** +$129.42
    *   *Net positive impact from correcting invoices billed at incorrect, lower rates.*

### **4. Recommended Actions**

A three-pronged approach is recommended to address these findings, mitigate immediate risk, and prevent recurrence.

#### **4.1. Immediate Corrective Actions**

1.  **Void Invoices:** Immediately void all identified duplicate invoices (21 total) and phantom billing invoices (5 total) to prevent customer over-payment and complaints.
2.  **Correct Invoices:** Re-issue the 13 invoices identified with incorrect billing rates to reflect the proper contract terms and capture an additional **$129.42**.
3.  **Issue New Invoices:** Generate and send invoices for the 5 identified missing charges to recover **$310.50** in unbilled revenue.

#### **4.2. Further Investigation**

1.  **Quantify Full Impact:** Assign the Forensic Billing Auditor the priority task of manually calculating the full financial impact of the remaining **11 duplicate invoice groups** and the **182 usage mismatches**. This is critical to understanding the full scope of our financial exposure.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Initiate a deep-dive analysis into the root causes of the usage mismatches, which represent the largest single category of errors.

#### **4.3. Systemic and Process Improvements**

1.  **Enhance Duplicate Detection:** Implement a more robust, automated check within the billing system to prevent the generation or sending of duplicate invoices for the same service period.
2.  **Implement Usage Validation:** Enforce a system rule that prohibits the generation of an invoice unless there is a corresponding, validated usage log for the billing period.
3.  **Automate Rate Synchronization:** Improve the integration between the contract management system and the billing platform to ensure that rate changes are automatically and accurately reflected in all invoices.
4.  **Strengthen Data Integrity:** Review the data pipeline from service usage logging to the billing system to identify and fix weaknesses that lead to data mismatches.
